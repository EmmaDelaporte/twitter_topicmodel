An attempt at biterm topic modeling for twitter data

For my final assignment in Quantitative Text Analysis, I conducted a thematic analysis of tweets published by Tech Union accounts. After scraping the twitter feeds of a pre-selected list of union accounts, I cleaned the text and prepared it for analyis. I then tested out using an LDA topic model and a biterm topic model to explore which method would result in more coherent topic outcomes.
